Face Recognition With Cloud Computing

This project is a facial recognition estimation project with an android application. The project consists of 3 parts: Android application, Recognition model and Flask API.
Briefly, the project works like this: We send a face photo taken with the Android application to the Flask API, where the Recognition Model is installed, via the ngrok tunnel. Then the Flask API sends a response to the Android application. And we see this response on the screen.

I am proud to say that this project is done by me Onur SaldamlÄ± and my team mate Ezgi Eftekin and is our graduation thesis.
