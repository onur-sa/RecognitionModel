# RecognitionModel
Graduation Thesis of Data Analytics of IOT (2019)
Since this project is done through Google Colab, first of all, the Google Drive account must be mounted.
Before creating a model, we must subject our train data to certain processes in order to create the model as quickly and as accurately as possible. We reconstruct each of the train data with the ImageDataGenerator() function.

We create the model with Sequental() and then create the layers of the model. We designed such a model by seeing that 5 layers gave better results through trial and error.
